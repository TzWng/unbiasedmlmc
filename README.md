This package is based on the package "unbiasedmcmc" by Pierre E. Jacob on <https://github.com/pierrejacob/unbiasedmcmc>.

The package contains data and code to reproduce the results of “Unbiased Multilevel Monte Carlo methods for intractable distributions: MLMC meets MCMC”, by Guanyang Wang and Tianze Wang, available at <https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04808>


### Installation

The package can be installed from R via:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TzWng/unbiasedmlmc")
```


### Numerical Examples

All the examples in the paper can be reproduced using the code in the file "inst". 
One can run the code on clusters with the shell files.

### Figures

To get the figures, one could loading the corresponding data then run the code in "Figure".
